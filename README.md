# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to discover the optimal conditions in which to launch a Kickstarter for a play. 

## Analysis and Challenges

Kickstarters from 2009-2017 were studied in a multitude of aspects. Outcomes based on launch dates in the theater category were modeled as well as Outcomes based upon goals for plays. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

For Outcomes based on Launch date, the number of successful, failed, and canceled were broken down by month. Also, an outcome's percentage was calculated to take into account different months having different amount of kickstarters. The number of successful, failed, and canceled theater kickstarters were modeled on a chart.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Goals were broken down into different ranges across successful, failed, and canceled plays. Percentages were also calculated which was modeled in a line chart.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One challenge was making sure the data was accurately represented and not simply taking the first result at face value. For example, in the Outcomes by launch date, it appears that May, June, and July are clearly the best based upon the chart to launch a theater kickstarter. However, as detailed below, when taking percentages into account it shows that April and February tie July for successful launch percentage.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Looking at Outcomes based on Launch Date, the months of May, June, and July were the most successful while December, October, and August were the least. This can be seen on the included line chart. Looking at the success percentage, May is 67% and June is at 65%, followed by July as well as April and February at 63%. While the three months are tied on percentage, July had more plays successfully launched because there were more plays in total, 138 in July, compared to 113 for April and February. December has the lowest success rate at 49% and a failure of 47%. October is second lowest at a 57% success rate and 43% failure rate. So one conclusion would be launching in May or June would be preferred, followed by July/April/February. Second conclusion would be to avoid lauching in December or October as those have the highest rates of failure. Also, theater kickstarters seem to be rarely canceled.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Plays with goals less than $20,000 have had 50% or greater success rate, with 94% of plays in this range. $35000 to $45000 have had a 67& of success, but only 0.9% of plays are in this range. One conclusion would be the farther under $20,000 one's goal is, the better. Infact, goals under $5,000 have succeeded more than 70% of the time.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One limitation is not knowing how the different kickstarters were marketed. For example, maybe the more successful kickstarters had a variety of marketing types such as digital/physical/commercials/etc. Whereas the ones that failed only had one of those or even none? Also, the "Spotlight" column is not defined. What does that mean? Was it promoted on the Kickstarter page? Was it actively advertised? Also same for "Staff Pick." What staff and who?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

A chart with Outcome by country could be useful, especially if one is trying to choose where their Kickstarter may be most successful. A chart with the Percentage Funded would be helpful as perhaps many successes for a category may barely reach their goal while others with few successes might be funded far beyond their goal.
